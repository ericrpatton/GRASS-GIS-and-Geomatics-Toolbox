# mb.processed_datalist_xyzdump_and_grid.sh - This script accepts an MB-System
# processed datalist as input; it is expected that all preprocessing has
# already been done (i.e., datalist are ceated, mbpreprocess has been run. See
# unpack_and_preprocess.sh for details) and generates the ancillary files (if
# needed), performs a rudimentary cleaning using mbclean, processes the data,
# exports an xyz file of the processed data, imports this xyz data into GRASS
# GIS, assigns the resultant raster a rainbow colour table, and create—ï a
# coloured, shaded-relief raster of this data.
#
# This script is basically a clone of mb.gridtiles, except that it doesn't have
# to cope with managing memory and gridding regions; it just exports the full
# xyz dump and r.in.xyz handles importing the data into GRASS in chunks.

Optimal dd flags for creating a bootable disk image

Caveats:

-	The disk which is being copied to *must* be the same size or larger than the
	iso image being copied.

- never ever use dd (or any other tool) to modify a partition that's currently
  mounted! Unmount it first. Anything else virtually guarantees corruption as
  the filesystem driver and whatever tool you're using step on each other.


Flags:

conv: conv=sync,noerror tells dd that if it can't read a block due to a read
error, then it should at least write something to its output of the correct
length.

bs: block size, how big a chunk should the data be parsed by. Determine an
	optimal setting to use by running the script "dd_obs_test.sh" in
	~/coderepo/.

noerror: Continue after read errors.

oflag=direct: use direct I/O for data.

status: The LEVEL of information to print to stderr; 'progress' shows periodic
transfer statistics.

dd bs=4M if=path/to/filename.iso of=/dev/sdx conv=noerror,sync oflag=direct status=progress

# GRASS-GIS-and-Geomatics-Toolbox

This is a collection of GIS tools and bash scripts I've been working on for the past 18 years at my job as a Marine Geoscience Technologist at Natural Resources Canada. Not all of them are my scripts - some are scripts and tools I've collected from other GIS users that have proved useful to me.

Some are in various states of completion (although most, in fact, work); they are mostly centered on using GRASS GIS and other open source geomatics tools such as GDAL/OGR, Generic Mapping Tools, GEOS, and MB-System to solve various data formatting, visualization, and geoprocessing tasks I've encountered over the years, particularly in the context of seafloor swath bathymetry data processing. 

For GRASS GIS users - scripts follow the same naming convention as GRASS GIS programs; r.* scripts are raster processing scripts, v.* scripts are vector-related, g.* scripts are general GRASS processing scripts.

Similarly, MB-System-specific scripts begin with mb.*.

I may not have 100% consistent in the naming convention my scripts, because up until now (January 2022), I have not shared my scripts publically before, and I was comfortable with whatever naming conventions I was using at the time. There could definitely be some cleanup in this regard; I am actively updating the naming convention of my scripts to be more intuitive and, (hopefully), consistent.

I am placing these on Github with the hope that they might be useful for anyone else in a similar role as mine. Undoubtedly, there are bugs and improvements that can be made; feel free to clone and fork, suggest improvements, etc. I don't consider myself a "programmer" by any means, as will be obvious to anyone who looks at this work, but just a regular GIS user trying to learn as much as I can to work more efficiently at my job.
